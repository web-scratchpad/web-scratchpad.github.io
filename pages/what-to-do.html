      		<h1>What to Do?</h1>
  		<p>Similar to why care, there are two angles we must consider</p>
  		<ul>
    			<li>How to make sure that seniors get access to the help they need</li>
    			<li>How to counteract the damage that an increasing number of seniors will due to our economy</li>
  		</ul>
  		<p>The good news is that steps are already being taken to help out our seniors.
  		A not-for-profit in BC, called "Volunteer Grandparents" is especially successful.
  		It matches a child with a senior, and has been said to "foster positive relationships and improve self esteem for both parties".</p>
		
		<p>Canada has several programs in place to keep seniors out of poverty, notabley the Old Age Secuity.
		This plan is far from perfect, but it does 2 important things to help balance the problem:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>OAS pension for almost all seniors makes sure that everyone gets at least some help from the government.</li>
			<li>Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) is a plan that gets low incomde seniors more help, 
				which starts to balance the monetary inequalities of aging.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>The Economy</h2>
		<p>We have already seen how Canada's aging population will impact the economy, from an increased dependency workload to a decreased tax base.
		Canada is trying to solve the problem, but what they are doing isn't enough. Lets look at one of the best ways to kickstart a dying economy: immigration.</p>
		<h3>Immigration</h3>
  		<p>The Canadian government has been trying to fight the economic impacts of an aging population as well as the social ones.
  		Canada is bringing in more and more immigrants to supplement our workforce, which grants many benefits to our economy, including:</p>
  		<ul>
   			<li>An increased tax base</li>
    			<li>More workers</li>
    			<li>Boosting trade</li>
  		</ul>

		<div class="footnote">
			<p>Shows immigration rates in Canada. Note how they are going up rather slowly</p>
		</div>
		<p>Canada's attempts to bring enough immigrants to build up the workforce are helping, but they simply aren't enough. 
		To counteract this problem we need to bring more immigrants into our country, and with the masses of Canadian land available, 
		its a wonder that the government hasn't already stepped up their immigration game.</p>
		<h2>Other Countries</h3>
		<p>Its not just Canada that is facing the impacts of an aging population. 
		Japan is a prime example of a country with an aging population that is actually trying to remedy their problem, so lets look at what they are doing.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Japan has a very good long-term health care insurance system, known as one of the most generous and comprehensive health insurance plans in the world.</li>
			<li>The Japenese government is jumpstarting the med tech and aged-care industries with subsidies to boost their economy.</li>
			<li>Japan has taken many steps to encourage couples to have children, including vowing to provide free preschool care and education.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>These steps highlight 3 important steps to remedy an aging population. 
		The first is to take care of your elders, they are citizens and should be protected. Japan did this with its strong long-term health insurance plan.
		The next is to keep your economy going, despite the decreasing workforce. 
		Japan did this by investing in med tech and aged-care, industries it knows will do well because of the large number of seniors.
		Finally, you need to find a way to bring more young people into your country, and encouraging more people to have children is a great way to do that.</p>
		
		<p>Hopefully I have done a good job of showing how Canada's aging population is a threat to it's economy and citizens, and some potential solutions.
