      <h1>What to Do?</h1>
  	<p>Similar to why care, there are two angles we must consider</p>
  	<ul>
    		<li>How to make sure that seniors get access to the help they need</li>
    		<li>How to counteract the damage that an increasing number of seniors will due to our economy</li>
  	</ul>
  	<p>The good news is that steps are already being taken to help out our seniors.
  	A not-for-profit in BC, called "Volunteer Grandparents" is especially successful.
  	It matches a child with a senior, and has been said to "foster positive relationships and improve self esteem for both parties".</p>

  	<p>The Canadian government has been trying to boost the economic impacts as well.
  	Canada is bringing in more and more immigrants to supplement our workforce, which grants many benefits to our economy, including:</p>
  	<ul>
   		<li>An increased tax base</li>
    		<li>More workers</li>
    		<li>Boosting trade</li>
  	</ul>
