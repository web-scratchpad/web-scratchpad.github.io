      		<h1>Why Care</h1>
  		<p>As more people age, 2 main problems occur</p>
  		<ul>
    			<li>The dependency workload on the shrinking workforce will increase, as more people age out of it and need taking care of. This will result in an economic crash.</li>
    			<li>Seniors cannot access all of the services they need, due to a lack of steady income, or poorly designed support systems.</li>
  		</ul>
		<p>
  		This creates issues on many levels, but lets start with individual needs.
		</p>
  		<h3>Senior's Needs</h3>
  		<p>One of the most important resources for the elderly is healthcare, and an aging population has the potential to put a strain on the very healthcare system they rely on.
  		Even in 2011, 85% of hospital beds were occupied by seniors, a number which has no doubt increased since.
  		This will eventually result in a decrease in the quality in healthcare for everyone, including seniors, adults in the workforce and children.
  		</p>
  		<p>
  		As seniors age, they need to have money to spend on care, food, housing, etc. 
		One of the best ways to make sure that our seniors have access to important resources in with a pension plan. 
		Unfortunately the number of people with pension plans has been decreasing for the last few decades.
		</p>

		<p>
  		As people live longer they will need to work for longer periods of time in order to retire, especially without a pension plan.
  		Whats scary, is that this is not happening.
  		In 2016, the Auditor General's office said that "people are living longer and not retiring", and that the "public pension plans are at risk over longer life spans".
  		Its not hard to see why. The government had spent 6.5 billion dollars filling a funding deficit in the Canadian Pension Plan for the last 3 years.
  		The Canadian Pention Plan is not being managed well, and as more and more seniors retire, more strain is being put on it, making for an uncertain future.
  		</p>

  		<h3>Economic Issues</h3>
  		<p>
  		The ability of seniors to get what they need is only one convern. We must also ask ourselves if it will be there for them to take.
  		As more people age out of the workforce, there will be fewer people working and less workers will slow down the economy.
  		Right now Canadaâ€™s dependency load is 60/100, but it is expected to rise to 85/100 by 2056.

  		<p>
  		Canada's economy is already weak, and an increasing dependency load will make it even worse.
  		This could threaten the ability of everyone, including seniors, to get what they need.
  		</p>
		<p>This will result in several unpleasant side effects, including:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Taxes will have to increase so that the government can keep up struggling social services including healthcare, infastructure, etc. 
				This will put an even greater strain on the few workers still in the workforce.</li>
			<li>The retirement age will slowly be pushed up as the cost of life increases and with it the cost of retiring. 
				This would create massive inequalities, as those without money will be forced to work for even larger amounts of their life.</li>
			<li>An increased retirement age is only a patch job, 
				as a lot of important basic jobs that drive the economy are in primary fields like agriculture and mining, requiring fit and young workers.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		Hopefully it is now clear why Canada's aging population is such a problem. 
		Our seniors need more support, and Canada's economy is not in a great position.
		Lets look at possible solutions to these problems, and what other countries are doing.
