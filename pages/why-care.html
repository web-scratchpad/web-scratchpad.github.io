      		<h1>why care</h1>
  		<p>As more people age, 2 main problems occur</p>
  		<ul>
    			<li>The dependency workload on the shrinking workforce will increase, as more people age out of it and need taking care of. This will result in an economic crash.</li>
    			<li>Seniors cannot access all of the services they need, due to a lack of steady income</li>
  		</ul>
		<p>
  		This creates issues on many levels, but lets start with individual needs.
		</p>
  		<h3>Senior's Needs</h3>
  		<p>One of the most important resources for the elderly is healthcare, and an aging population has the potential to put a strain on our healthcare system.
  		Even in 2011, 85% of hospital beds were occupied by seniors, a number which has no doubt increased since.
  		This will result in a decrease in the quality in healthcare for everyone, including seniors, adults in the workforce and children.
  		</p>
  		<p>
  		As seniors age, they need to have money to spend on care, food, housing, etc.
  		As people live longer they will need to work for longer periods of time in order to retire.
  		Whats scary, is that this is not happening.
  		In 2016, the Auditor General's office said that "people are living longer and not retiring", and that the "public pension plans are at risk over longer life spans".
  		Its not hard to see why. The government had spent 6.5 billion dollars filling a funding deficit in the last 3 years.
  		The Canadian Pention Plan is not being managed well, and as more and more seniors retire, more strain is being put on it, making for an uncertain future.
  		</p>

  		<h3>Economic Issues</h3>
  		<p>
  		The ability of seniors to get what they need is only one convern. We must also ask ourselves if it will be there for them to take.
  		As more people age out of the workforce, there will be fewer people working and less workers will slow down the economy.
  		Right now Canada’s dependency load is 60/100, but it is expected to rise to 85/100 by 2056.
  		Canada's economy is already weak, and an increasing dependency load will make it even worse.
  		This could threaten the ability of everyone, including seniors, to get what they need.
  		</p>
		<p>
  		As the workforce shrinks, taxes will have to increase so the government can make enough money.
  		As the retirement age slowly goes up, we will see inequities around the country.
  		Already 1% of the population consumes ½ of the Canadian healthcare budget each year, and disparities like that can only get worse as time passes.
