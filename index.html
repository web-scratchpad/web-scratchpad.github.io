			<h2>What is Happening?</h2>
  			<p>Canada as a country is aging. As of 2011, 14.4% of Canada’s population were seniors, which will increase to 23% by just 2030.</p>
  			<img src="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/seniors-action-report.html" alt="Did not load: graph of Canada's average population">
  			<h3>This aging population is caused by 2 things</h3>
  			<ul>
    				<li>An increase in life expectancy</li>
    				<li>A very low birth rate</li>
  			</ul>
  			<p>Lets unpack this. In 2019, Canada’s fertility rate was 1.47, down from 3.94 in 1959. This means that every potential couple is producing less than 2 children, resulting in a net decrease in the younger population.</p>

  			<p>When we consider average life span, we see the opposite. In 2011, Canadians lived an average of 81.7 years. This is an increase of 24.6 years since 1921.The trend is very clear. Canadian's are living longer, but new ones are not being born, resulting in an aging population.</p>
