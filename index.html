			<h2>What is Happening?</h2>
			<p>Canada as a country is aging. As of 2011, 14.4% of Canada’s population were seniors, which will increase to 23% by just 2030. 
				By 2036, 2.4 million seniors will need continuing care, which will rise to 3.3 in 2046.</p>

			<h3>This aging population is caused by 2 factors</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>An increase in life expectancy</li>
				<li>A very low birth rate</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Lets unpack this. In 2019, Canada’s fertility rate was 1.47, down from 3.94 in 1959. 
				This means that every potential couple is producing fewer than 2 children, resulting in a net decrease in the younger population.</p>

			<p>When we consider average life span, we see the opposite. In 2011, Canadians lived an average of 81.7 years. 
			This is an increase of 24.6 years since 1921. Additionally, in 2016 for the first time, seniors outnumbered children in Canada. 
			The trend is very clear. Canadians are living longer, but new ones are not being born, resulting in an aging population.</p>
			<p>Another great way to look at a population's age and the practical impacts this age has is the depedency workload.
			Right now Canada’s dependency load is 60/100, but it is expected to rise to 85/100 by 2056. 
			This means that a large number of Canadians are no longer working, and does a great job of highlighting the severity of our problem.</p>

			<h2>Where is it Happening</h2>
			<p>The main location of this problem is in urban centers. In the far north, life expectancy is much lower. 
			In areas like Alberta we see lower average age because a lot of people go out there to work in oil or farm, then move back to urban centers as they age. 
			Seniors are able to get more care in cities, making urban areas a more desirable location, and a lot will also choose to live where they grew up, another reason for clusters in densly populated cities.</p>

  			<p>An aging population will not only impact the places where it is located, it will impact all of Canada.
			As the population ages, the people will prefer to remain in cities, however as space runs out in cities they will be forced to live elsewhere, spreading the problem throughout Canada.
			Locations like Toronto and Vancouver will see the results first, however eventually almost all parts of Canada will be changed because of its population's age.
