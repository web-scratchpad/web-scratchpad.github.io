			<h2>What is Happening?</h2>
			<p>Canada as a country is aging. As of 2011, 14.4% of Canada’s population were seniors, which will increase to 23% by just 2030.</p>

			<h3>This aging population is caused by 2 things</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>An increase in life expectancy</li>
				<li>A very low birth rate</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Lets unpack this. In 2019, Canada’s fertility rate was 1.47, down from 3.94 in 1959. This means that every potential couple is producing less than 2 children, resulting in a net decrease in the younger population.</p>

			<p>When we consider average life span, we see the opposite. In 2011, Canadians lived an average of 81.7 years. This is an increase of 24.6 years since 1921. The trend is very clear. Canadian's are living longer, but new ones are not being born, resulting in an aging population.</p>

			<h2>Where is it Happening</h2>
			<p>The main location of this problem is in urban centers. In the far north, life expectancy is much lower. In areas like Alberta we see lower average age because a lot of people go out there to work in oil or farm, then move back to urban centers as they age. </p>

  			<p>An aging population will not only impact the places where it is located though, it will impact all of Canada. Locations like Toronto will see the results first, however eventually almost all parts of Canada will be changed because of its population's age.</p>
